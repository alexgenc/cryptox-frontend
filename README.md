   git clone https://github.com/alexgenc/cryptox-frontend.git
   ```
2. Clone the backend repo to a separate directory by going to [https://github.com/alexgenc/cryptox-backend](https://github.com/alexgenc/cryptox-backend). From there, click Download Zip again from the green Code button at the top of the page or enter the following in a separate directory in your terminal:
   
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/alexgenc/cryptox-backend.git
   ```

### Library Installations

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

### Postgres Installation
